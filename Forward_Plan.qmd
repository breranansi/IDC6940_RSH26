## Proposed Workflow

## Introduction
First, We'll start with some sort of introduction.

## Definition
This is where we say what symbolic regression is.

## Importance
Here we talk about why we'd want to use symbolic regression.

## Competing Technologies
Here we talk about the alternatives:

### Neural Networks
This can provide answers, but cannot explain *why* those answers are correct. Yes, they are working on reasoning LLM's, but we are not there yet.

### General Linear Regression
This also provides answers, but the engineer or scientist has to decide on the form of the equation before using GLM to fit the constants.

### Sparse Regression
Here we present a variety of different functional forms to a regression model, and then throw away the forms with small constants. What's left tells us what kind of equation to use.  This is not *technically* sparse regression, but the workflow is very similar.
